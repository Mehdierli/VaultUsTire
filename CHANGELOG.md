- BigCommerce Bug Report

- Customer Support
  - Added Global Color settings to Theme Editor, found here: Global > Primary Color: Primary Color, Primary Hover Color, that should act as a catch-all for items styled with the primary and primary-light colors. Note: this will not replace the color controls we already have in place, but we have had it brought it to our attention that some buttons, including the list-view “compare” button text, the image “circle” selectors on the product page on hover, “view or edit your cart” button after adding to cart, Shipping & Coupon links on Cart page, amongst others were not adhering to theme editor changes. You should set these two settings to match your primary buttons and primary button hover colors.

  - Sticky nav colors in theme editor will now adjust on both desktop & mobile by using Sticky Nav settings.
Verified “Save this card for future transactions” checkbox when using Stripe Payment Gateway is working and styled correctly.
Verified “Gift Certificates” button and field are styled correctly throughout responsive window dragging, all the way down to mobile.

## 1.0.8 (2020-04-7)
- New Page Builder Features Included

- Customer Support
- Corrected the results message within quicksearch when it returns 0 results. The 0 was at the end. Corrected by setting the CSS to “direction: ltr;” on the element.
- Style fix for when checkbox options do not have a “field label and only have a “Display Title”. The “Display Title” will appear on its own line, above the checkbox as it is meant to appear as a title. When using a “field label”, the lable will appear on the same line as the corresponding checkbox to the right.
- We have added complete color options for the sticky nav, including the background-color, font-color, and font-hover-color.
- Fix for buggy mobile menu dropd-owns containing subcategories. This should correct the issue with items opening and the suddenly collapsing when attempting to expand. Also, clicking only the arrows will expand menu items, and clicking the text-link will send you to the corresponding page/category.
- z-index fix for modal windows. All modals wills now appear on top of main navigation.

## 1.0.7 (2019-10-23)
- Customer Addressed Issues
- Fix for un-clickable category links within Mega Nav flyout when there are nested categories beneath 3rd level.
- Fix for subcategory images on category pages appearing out of alignment in some instances. We have set a min-height for the text links beneath the images which will make the floated divs clear and align correctly as there is already a min-height set for the divs containing the images.
- Added Theme Editor options for independent control of Main Nav dropdown font-colors found here: Header & Footer > Main Navigation > Dropdown menu text color. This was only an issue when using white font setting for Main nav.
- Added Theme Editor options to hide/show product tabs on product page. Product Overview tab open by default.
- Added Theme Editor options to change mobile Nav icon colors. Found here: Mobile.

- BigCommerce Bug Report
- THEME-1890: Fix for: Vault – 2 deep level categories become unresponsive when using Simple Dropdown Menu display. This has been corrected. When simple dropdown setting is active, Flyout will work as expected and only display levels 1-3.
- THEME-1891: Fix for: Vault – Customizing theme to show product reviews results in hiding the reviews. This has been corrected so that when Theme Editor option within Products > Display Settings > “Show product reviews” is toggled it will hide/show accordingly.
- THEME-1894: Fix for: Vault – Category links in Mega Menu are unresponsive if they exceed 3 sub-categories deep. This has been corrected and tested using both simple & alternate menu settings.
- THEME-1851: Fix for: Vault 1.0.5 – Special characters in Brand name appear at front of string in menu. This has been corrected with style added to set direction: ltr;
